# CS-370-intelligent-agent
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
ANSWER: For  this project I was given starter code that set up the environment that my agent would have to be able to navigate. It also set up the actions that my agent would be able to do in this maze. What I had to do was to complete  the Q-learning implementation for the agent. This involved setting up the agent to find the best possible navigation sequence. While also maximizing the rewards.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
ANSWER: Computer scientists are responsible for creating software that is used in order to meet the demands of the users and stakeholder. This matters because software is what allows almost every industry to thrive as much as they have. Without the big improvments that have been made through computer science we may not have been able to live with the level of comfort that we have now. Beause of the mass amount of other advancements that software has allowed in other industries.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
ANSWER: What I normally do when I have a problem is write it down on paper and write down ideas that could possible solve this problem. After coming up with some ideas I go over each one and try to flesh it out more. After this I look to see if anyone else has had the same problem as me and see if I can find other solutions to help solve the problem.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
ANSWER: To the end user I have a responsibility to make sure that their personal information is handled with security in mind. Also design in a way that makes the software accessible to all users. And to be transparent about my designs. To the organization my responsibilities are to create clean and maintainable code. Give credit and never plagiarize from someone elses code. Also to protect intellectual property. Lastly to prioritize ethical decisions when it comes to designing software.
